# Given an array that is sorted and then rotated around an unknown point. Find if the array has a pair with a given sum â€˜xâ€™. It may be assumed that all elements in the array are distinct.

# Examples : 

# Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 6, 8, 9, 10}, x = 16
# Output: true
# There is a pair (6, 10) with sum 16

# Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, x = 35
# Output: true
# There is a pair (26, 9) with sum 35

# Input: arr[] = {11, 15, 26, 38, 9, 10}, x = 45
# Output: false
# There is no pair with sum 45.

        if temp in arr:
